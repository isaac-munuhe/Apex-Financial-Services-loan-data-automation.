Loan Data Analysis Project for Apex Financial Services
Overview
This project involves comprehensive analysis and modeling of loan data provided by Apex Financial Services. The goal is to understand various aspects of the loan application data, including applicant demographics, loan amounts, approval rates, and risk factors associated with the loan process. The project uses Python for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and segmentation analysis.

Installation and Setup
To run the project, the following Python libraries are required:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
scikit-learn: For machine learning and data preprocessing.
To install these libraries, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn openpyxl

1. Data Loading and Inspection
The dataset is loaded from an Excel file. Initial inspection involves checking for null values, understanding data types, and getting a preliminary view of the dataset structure.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_excel('/path/to/PDA_APEX_Loan_Data.xlsx', sheet_name='CW1')
print(data.head())
print(data.dtypes)
print(data.info())
2. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning steps include removing duplicates and converting categorical variables to appropriate data types for analysis.

python
Copy code
# Remove duplicates
data.drop_duplicates(subset='Loan_ID', inplace=True)

# Convert categorical variables
categorical_vars = ['Gender', 'Married', 'Dependents', 'Graduate', 'Self_Employed', 'Credit_History', 'Property_Area', 'Loan_Status']
data[categorical_vars] = data[categorical_vars].astype('category')
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves analyzing distributions of loan amounts, applicant incomes, and visualizing relationships such as loan status by gender.

python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Distribution of loan amounts
sns.histplot(data['LoanAmount'], kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Loan Amounts')
plt.show()

# Loan status by gender
sns.countplot(x='Loan_Status', hue='Gender', data=data)
plt.title('Loan Status by Gender')
plt.show()
4. Predictive Modeling
Using logistic regression to predict loan approval outcomes based on applicant features.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Prepare data
X = pd.get_dummies(data.drop('Loan_Status', axis=1))
y = data['Loan_Status'].cat.codes

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Model training
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Model evaluation
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
5. Segmentation Analysis
Using K-means clustering to segment the loan applicants based on income and loan amounts.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Standardize data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data[['ApplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount']])

# Clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
data['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)

# Visualize clusters
sns.scatterplot(x='ApplicantIncome', y='LoanAmount', hue='Cluster', data=data)
plt.title('Applicant Clusters by Income and Loan Amount')
plt.show()


python
Copy code
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Feature engineering
data['Debt_to_Income_Ratio'] = data['LoanAmount'] / data['ApplicantIncome']

# Model training and evaluation
X = data[['Debt_to_Income_Ratio', 'Credit_History']]
y = data['Loan_Status'].cat.codes

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5))
